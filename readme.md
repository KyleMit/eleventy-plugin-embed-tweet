## Installation

Install [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-embed-tweet)

```bash
npm install eleventy-plugin-embed-tweet --save
```

Add the following to your .`eleventy.js` config - see docs for options param:

```js
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {

    const pluginEmbedTweet = require("eleventy-plugin-embed-tweet")
    eleventyConfig.addPlugin(pluginEmbedTweet);

};
```

## Requirements

Requires signing up for free [twitter developer API account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) - see docs for walkthrough

This plugin relies on making live API calls during build by using async shortcodes which were added in [**Eleventy v0.10.0**](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v0.10.0-beta.1) so it's listed as a peer dependency

## Basic Usage

Embed a tweet anywhere you can use nunjucks templates using a shortcode with the tweet id like this:

### Nunjucks

```js
{% tweet "1188837207206977536" %}
```

> **Note**: ID must be passed as a string because [long numbers will truncate in JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER))

## Demo

Demo project available on github at [KyleMit/eleventy-plugin-embed-tweet-demo](https://github.com/KyleMit/eleventy-plugin-embed-tweet-demo) and live version hosted on [eleventy-embed-tweet.netlify.com/](https://eleventy-embed-tweet.netlify.com/)

## Goals

* Avoid client side API calls
* Minimize repetitive server side API calls
* Cache assets and API data so project can build offline
* Leverage free (personal) twitter API tier on build server
* Provide fallback for local development for distributed devs who want to run without adding credentials

## Todo

* [ ] Destructure API JSON before caching - only store info we care about
* [ ] Cache profile and media images
* [ ] Much better docs
* [ ] Figure out more consistent CSS structure
* [ ] Handle `<br>` elements
* [ ] Automate `npm publish`

### Setting up Twitter Account

### Setting .ENV variables

Once you sign up for a twitter account, you'll need to create a file named `.env` at the project root - it contains keys so it's excluded by the `.gitignore` so each person will have to manually create their own:

```env
TOKEN=********
TOKEN_SECRET=********
CONSUMER_KEY=********
CONSUMER_SECRET=********
```

Remember to update your `.gitignore` with `.env` so you don't commit your secrets

You'll also have to add the environment variables on your build server.

If you build without setting environment variables, the API call won't work, so the plugin will fallback to using the client side embed available from [publish.twitter.com](https://publish.twitter.com/#)

### Plugin Options

```js
let pluginEmbedTweet = require("eleventy-plugin-embed-tweet")

let tweetEmbedOptions = {
    cacheDirectory: '',    // default: ''
    useInlineStyles: true  // default: true
}

eleventyConfig.addPlugin(pluginEmbedTweet, tweetEmbedOptions);
```

#### `useInlineStyles`

By default the single embed will contain all the necessary html and css to render each tweet.  This occurs by including a `<style>` block along with the tweet.  If you're embedding multiple tweets per page, you may elect to separate the CSS into it's own area so it's not repeated multiple times

You can instantiate the plugin like this:

```js
eleventyConfig.addPlugin(pluginEmbedTweet, {useInlineStyles: false});
```

And then make sure to include the styles somewhere else on your page like this:

```html
<style type="text/css">{% tweetStyles %}</style>
```

**Feel free to also add your own styles** and customize however you'd like.  The official twitter widget is implemented as a web component and [makes styling through the shadow dom really tricky](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59493027/1366033) - but this sits as flat html on your page - so customize however you'd like

The rough structure of the html returned by this plugin looks like this:

```css
.tweet-card
    .tweet-header
        .tweet-profile
        .tweet-author
            .tweet-author-name
            .tweet-author-handle
        .tweet-bird
            .tweet-bird-icon
    .tweet-body
    .tweet-images
    .tweet-footer
        .tweet-like
            .tweet-like-icon.tweet-icon
            .tweet-like-count
        .tweet-date
```

#### `cacheDirectory`

Relying on an external, authenticated API to build your site has some tradeoffs:

* Build will fail if API is down (fire at twitter)
* Build will fail if you're offline (on a train)
* People who clone the repo will need to sign up for their own API keys in order to do a full build
* Increases build times with multiple repetitive calls (especially during debugging)
* Increases reliance on API over long term

To address these tradeoffs, this plugin can cache API calls locally which you can periodically commit to your repository.

To enable, you need to pass a cacheDirctory path relative to your project root where you'd like to have data saved:

```js
eleventyConfig.addPlugin(pluginEmbedTweet, {cacheDirectory: './tweets'});
```

Because this directory will be updated during build time, you must add a [`.eleventyignore`](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/ignores/) with the directories name, otherwise `eleventy --serve` can get stuck in an infinite loop when it detects changes and tries to rebuild the site during the build.

**File**: `.eleventyignore`

```bash
tweets/
```

I'd recommend periodically committing this file - the data should be largely unchanged as long as you've captured a new tweet, but the `favorites_count` may want to get refreshed over time.
